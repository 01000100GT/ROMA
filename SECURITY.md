- Post about it publicly on social media
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond necessary testing

### ✅ Please DO:

1. **Email us directly** at: [security@sentient.xyz](mailto:security@sentient.xyz)
2. **Encrypt your findings** using our PGP key (available at [sentient.xyz/pgp](https://sentient.xyz/pgp))
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential mitigations you've identified

## Security Best Practices

When using SentientResearchAgent, please follow these security best practices:

### 🔑 API Keys and Secrets

1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** or `.env` files (git-ignored)
3. **Rotate keys regularly**
4. **Use separate keys** for development and production

```bash
# Good: Using environment variables
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Bad: Hardcoding in source
api_key = "sk-abc123..."  # Never do this!
```

### 🛡️ LLM Security

1. **Validate all LLM outputs** before execution
2. **Use Human-in-the-Loop** for sensitive operations
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Monitor for prompt injection** attempts

### 🔐 Data Protection

1. **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest and in transit
2. **Implement access controls** for multi-user deployments
3. **Regularly audit** data access logs
4. **Follow data retention policies**

### 🌐 Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
2. **Implement CORS policies** for web interface
3. **Keep dependencies updated**
4. **Use firewall rules** to restrict access

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM-Related Risks

- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious inputs could manipulate agent behavior
- **Data Leakage**: LLMs might inadvertently expose training data
- **Hallucination**: Agents might generate false information

**Mitigations**:
- Enable HITL for critical operations
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement output filtering
- Use constrained generation when possible

### Dependencies

We regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Run:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pdm audit

# Update dependencies
pdm update
```
