> Can you give me a comprehensive overview of how context flows in this hierarchical task decomposition frameworks? It's a recursive 
  top-down bottom-up approach where tasks are broken down and then collected again to answer the parent and so on. But I need extremely 
  thorough analysis on how this works.

⏺ I'll analyze the context flow in this hierarchical task decomposition framework by examining the codebase systematically.

⏺ Task(Analyze context flow in framework)
  ⎿  Done (17 tool uses · 74.2k tokens · 2m 39.1s)                                                                                      

⏺ Comprehensive Overview of Context Flow in the Hierarchical Task Decomposition Framework

  Based on my analysis, here's how context flows through this sophisticated recursive system:

  Core Architecture: Top-Down Decomposition → Bottom-Up Aggregation

  The framework implements a bidirectional context flow pattern:

  1. Downward Flow (Decomposition Phase)
    - Root task establishes overall objective and constraints
    - Parent nodes pass accumulated context + their own insights to children
    - Each level inherits all ancestor context through ParentContextBuilder
    - Children receive parent's goal, output summary, and planning reasoning
  2. Horizontal Flow (Sibling Coordination)
    - Multiple strategies determine which siblings provide context:
        - Dependencies: Explicit via depends_on_indices
      - Prerequisites: Earlier siblings in execution order
      - Goal References: Tasks mentioned by ID in goals
    - Prevents redundant work and enables building on sibling outputs
  3. Upward Flow (Aggregation Phase)
    - When all children complete, parent enters AGGREGATING state
    - AggregatingNodeHandler collects child results as ContextItem objects
    - Smart sizing via get_smart_child_context() manages token limits
    - Aggregator agents synthesize child outputs with horizontal context

  Key Implementation Details

  Context Resolution Pipeline:
  1. Strategy Selection (priority-based)
     → DependencyContext (highest)
     → ParentContext
     → PrerequisiteSiblingContext
     → AncestorBranchContext
     → GoalReferenceContext (lowest)

  2. Context Building
     → get_task_record_path_to_root() traverses ancestry
     → build_parent_context() structures hierarchical info
     → resolve_context_for_agent_with_parents() combines all sources

  3. Context Formatting
     → Smart summarization for large contexts
     → Generic summary detection and replacement
     → LLM-friendly sectioned output

  Storage & State Management:
  - KnowledgeStore: Central repository storing all task records with relationships
  - TaskNode: Active task representation with result, summary, and metadata
  - TaskGraph: Maintains hierarchical structure and navigation methods

  Critical Methods:
  - resolve_input_for_planner_agent(): Provides parent/sibling context for planning
  - create_sub_nodes(): Establishes parent-child links and dependencies
  - get_smart_child_context(): Intelligently sizes content for aggregation
  - enhanced_context_builder.resolve_context_for_agent_with_parents(): Main context resolution

  The framework ensures complete context awareness at each level while managing token limits through intelligent summarization and
  priority-based inclusion strategies.
