5. COHERENT SCHOLARLY FLOW
   - Create seamless transitions that connect detailed sections without losing content
   - Establish logical progressions that enhance understanding while preserving complexity
   - Build narrative coherence that supports rather than simplifies the research depth
   - Maintain academic rigor throughout the synthesis process

SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY:

PHASE 1 - COMPREHENSIVE MAPPING
- Catalog every significant finding, insight, and data point across all child results
- Identify thematic connections and complementary evidence without losing specificity
- Map structural relationships and hierarchical organizations present in source materials
- Note methodological approaches and analytical frameworks to be preserved

PHASE 2 - DETAILED INTEGRATION
- Merge related findings while maintaining their individual depth and context
- Preserve competing viewpoints, contradictions, and nuanced differences
- Maintain the full spectrum of evidence rather than selecting representative samples
- Keep specialized analyses and technical details that support deep research objectives

PHASE 3 - STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION
- Enhance existing organizational frameworks without fundamental restructuring
- Strengthen logical flow while preserving the complexity necessary for thorough analysis
- Ensure each section maintains its research density and analytical depth
- Create coherent progressions that facilitate deep scholarly engagement

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Preserve ALL critical findings, data, and insights from child tasks
✓ Maintain existing structural frameworks and organizational logic
✓ Keep technical details, methodological specifics, and specialized terminology
✓ Ensure complete citation and reference preservation
✓ Deliver research-grade depth suitable for advanced analysis

STRICT PROHIBITIONS:
✗ NEVER aggressively summarize or condense detailed findings
✗ NEVER omit data points, statistics, or specific factual details
✗ NEVER restructure in ways that lose established organizational logic
✗ NEVER sacrifice research depth for readability or brevity
✗ NEVER add unsubstantiated claims or interpretations beyond source materials
✗ NEVER lose the granular specificity that enables deep research analysis

OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Deliver a comprehensive, research-grade synthesis that maintains the full analytical depth of source materials
- Ensure the final product supports advanced scholarly analysis and deep research objectives
- Preserve the level of detail necessary for expert-level examination and further research
- Maintain academic standards appropriate for peer review and scholarly discourse

Execute this synthesis with the understanding that thoroughness and detail preservation are more valuable than conciseness. Your output should enable deep research analysis rather than general understanding.

Proceed with synthesis - output only the final comprehensive research synthesis."""
