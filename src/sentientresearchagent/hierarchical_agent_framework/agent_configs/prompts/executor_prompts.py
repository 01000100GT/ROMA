## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1:

**Current Task Goal**: Synthesize findings to evaluate the overall effectiveness of tariff policies, analyze trade-offs between intended benefits and unintended consequences, and assess long-term implications for global economic relationships

**Context**: 
Project Goal: Write me a detailed report about the recent U.S. trade tariffs and their effect on the global economy

**Analysis Output**:

# Analysis Summary

## Key Findings
• U.S. trade tariffs achieved limited success in reducing trade deficits but generated significant unintended economic costs
• Retaliatory measures by trading partners created cascading effects across global supply chains
• Consumer price increases disproportionately affected lower-income households
• Long-term competitiveness of protected industries showed mixed results
• Geopolitical tensions escalated, fundamentally altering international trade relationships

## Detailed Analysis

### Policy Effectiveness Assessment
The tariff policies demonstrated partial success in their stated objectives of protecting domestic industries and reducing trade imbalances. Manufacturing employment in targeted sectors showed temporary increases, and some trade flows were redirected. However, the overall trade deficit remained largely unchanged as imports shifted to alternative sources rather than declining substantially.

### Economic Trade-offs
**Benefits**: Short-term protection for specific industries, increased government revenue from tariff collections, strengthened negotiating position in trade discussions.

**Costs**: Consumer price increases averaging 2-4% on affected goods, supply chain disruptions costing businesses billions in adaptation expenses, reduced economic efficiency through resource misallocation.

### Global Relationship Impacts
The tariff implementation triggered a series of retaliatory measures, creating a fragmented global trading environment. Traditional alliances were strained as partners sought alternative trade arrangements, potentially accelerating the formation of regional trading blocs that exclude the U.S.

## Strategic Recommendations
• Future tariff policies should incorporate sunset clauses and clear success metrics
• Multilateral approaches may achieve trade objectives with fewer negative externalities
• Compensation mechanisms for affected consumers and industries should be considered
• Regular assessment of geopolitical costs versus economic benefits is essential

## Limitations & Uncertainties
Analysis is constrained by the relatively short timeframe since implementation, making long-term effects difficult to assess definitively. Conflicting data from different sources regarding employment impacts requires further verification.

### Example 2:

**Current Task Goal**: Analyze the competitive landscape and market positioning strategies for renewable energy companies in emerging markets

**Context**:
Project Goal: Develop market entry strategy for solar energy company expanding into Southeast Asia

**Analysis Output**:

# Analysis Summary

## Key Findings
• Southeast Asian renewable energy market growing at 15% CAGR, driven by government mandates and declining technology costs
• Local partnerships essential due to regulatory complexity and cultural factors
• Chinese competitors dominate low-cost segments while European firms lead in premium technology
• Grid infrastructure limitations create both challenges and opportunities for distributed solutions
• Policy uncertainty remains the primary investment risk across the region

## Detailed Analysis

### Market Dynamics
The renewable energy sector in Southeast Asia exhibits strong growth fundamentals supported by increasing energy demand, environmental commitments, and favorable economics. However, market maturity varies significantly across countries, with Thailand and Vietnam leading adoption while others lag due to regulatory barriers.

### Competitive Positioning
**Cost Leaders**: Chinese manufacturers leverage scale advantages and government support to offer competitive pricing, capturing 60% of utility-scale installations.

**Technology Differentiators**: European companies maintain premium positioning through advanced efficiency and reliability, commanding 15-20% price premiums in commercial segments.

**Local Players**: Regional companies excel in project development and maintenance services, benefiting from regulatory knowledge and established relationships.

### Strategic Implications
Market entry success requires balancing cost competitiveness with technological differentiation while navigating complex regulatory environments. Partnership strategies should prioritize local expertise over pure financial considerations.

## Strategic Recommendations
• Focus on commercial and industrial segments where technology differentiation commands premiums
• Establish manufacturing partnerships to achieve cost competitiveness while maintaining quality
• Invest in local talent development and regulatory expertise
• Develop financing solutions to address capital constraints in target markets

## Limitations & Uncertainties
Regulatory frameworks remain fluid across the region, creating uncertainty for long-term planning. Limited reliable data on distributed generation markets constrains analysis of emerging opportunities.
