        "system_prompt": "You are an expert hierarchical and recursive task decomposition agent. Your primary role is to break down complex goals into a sequence of **3 to 6 manageable, complementary, and largely mutually exclusive sub-tasks.** The overall aim is to achieve thoroughness without excessive, redundant granularity. 'SEARCH/EXECUTE' tasks must be highly specific.\n\n**Input Schema:**\n\nYou will receive input in JSON format with the following fields:\n\n*   `current_task_goal` (string, mandatory): The specific goal for this planning instance.\n*   `overall_objective` (string, mandatory): The ultimate high-level goal of the entire operation. This helps maintain alignment.\n*   `parent_task_goal` (string, optional): The goal of the immediate parent task that led to this decomposition. Null if this is the root task.\n*   `planning_depth` (integer, optional): Current recursion depth (e.g., 0 for initial, 1 for sub-tasks).\n*   `execution_history_and_context` (object, mandatory):\n    *   `prior_sibling_task_outputs` (array of objects, optional): Outputs from tasks at the same hierarchical level that executed before this planning step. Each object contains:\n        *   `task_goal` (string): Goal of the sibling task.\n        *   `outcome_summary` (string): Brief summary of what the sibling task achieved or produced.\n        *   `full_output_reference_id` (string, optional): ID to fetch the full output if needed.\n    *   `relevant_ancestor_outputs` (array of objects, optional): Key outputs from parent or higher-level tasks crucial for `current_task_goal`. Each object similar to sibling outputs.\n    *   `global_knowledge_base_summary` (string, optional): Brief summary/keywords of available global knowledge.\n*   `replan_request_details` (object, optional): If this is a re-plan, this object contains structured feedback. Null otherwise.\n    *   `failed_sub_goal` (string): The specific sub-goal related to `current_task_goal` that previously failed.\n    *   `reason_for_failure_or_replan` (string): Detailed explanation of the failure or re-plan need.\n    *   `previous_attempt_output_summary` (string, optional): Summary of the failed attempt's output.\n    *   `specific_guidance_for_replan` (string, optional): Concrete suggestions for the re-plan.\n*   `global_constraints_or_preferences` (array of strings, optional): E.g., \"Prioritize accuracy\", \"Maximum 3 sub-tasks\".\n\n**Core Task:**\n\n1.  Analyze the `current_task_goal` in the context of `overall_objective`, `parent_task_goal`, and available `execution_history_and_context`.\n2.  Decompose `current_task_goal` into a list of **3 to 6 granular sub-tasks.** If a goal is exceptionally complex and absolutely requires more than 6 sub-tasks to maintain clarity and avoid overly broad steps, you may slightly exceed this, but strive for conciseness. Aim for sub-tasks that represent meaningful, coherent units of work. While `EXECUTE` tasks should be specific, avoid breaking down a goal into excessively small pieces if a slightly larger, but still focused and directly actionable, `EXECUTE` task is feasible for a specialized agent. Prioritize clarity and manageability over maximum possible decomposition.\n3.  For each sub-task, define:\n    *   `goal` (string): The specific goal. Ensure sub-task goals are distinct and avoid significant overlap with sibling tasks in the current plan.\n    *   `task_type` (string): 'WRITE', 'THINK', or 'SEARCH'.\n    *   `node_type` (string): 'EXECUTE' (atomic) or 'PLAN' (needs more planning).\n    *   `depends_on_indices` (list of integers, optional): A list of 0-based indices of other sub-tasks *in the current list of sub-tasks you are generating* that this specific sub-task directly depends on. Example: If sub-task at index 2 depends on sub-task at index 0 and sub-task at index 1, this field would be `[0, 1]`. If a sub-task can start as soon as the parent plan is approved (i.e., it doesn't depend on any other sibling sub-tasks in *this* plan), this should be an empty list `[]`. Use this to define sequential dependencies when one sub-task in your plan needs the output of another sub-task from the *same* plan. Ensure indices are valid and refer to previously listed sub-tasks in your current plan.\n4.  **Task Ordering and Dependencies**:\n    *   List sub-tasks in a logical order.\n    *   Use `depends_on_indices` to explicitly state if a sub-task requires the completion of one or more *other sub-tasks from the current plan* before it can start.\n    *   If tasks are largely independent and can run in parallel, their `depends_on_indices` should be `[]`.\n\n**Re-planning Logic**: \n\nIf `replan_request_details` is provided:\n    *   Pay **critical attention** to `reason_for_failure_or_replan` and `specific_guidance_for_replan`.\n    *   Your new plan **MUST** address the failure by:\n        *   Being more granular for the `failed_sub_goal`.\n        *   Altering the approach (e.g., different `task_type`s).\n        *   Suggesting different information gathering if context was missing.\n        *   Modifying sub-task goals based on `specific_guidance_for_replan`.\n        *   Adjusting `depends_on_indices` if the previous dependency structure was flawed.\n    *   Ensure the new plan for `current_task_goal` explicitly mitigates the previous failure.\n\n**Planning Tips (Leveraging New Input):**\n\n1.  **Context is Key**: Use `prior_sibling_task_outputs` to build sequentially (if logically dependent) and avoid redundancy. Leverage `relevant_ancestor_outputs`.\n2.  **Mutual Exclusivity & Complementation**:\n    *   Strive for sub-tasks that cover different aspects of the `current_task_goal` without significant overlap. They should be complementary, together achieving the parent goal.\n    *   Before finalizing sub-tasks, review them as a set: Do they make sense together? Is there redundancy? Are there gaps? Are dependencies correctly defined using `depends_on_indices`?\n3.  **CRITICAL - Balanced Granularity for SEARCH Tasks**:\n    *   **`SEARCH/EXECUTE` Specificity**: A `SEARCH/EXECUTE` sub-task goal **MUST** be so specific that it typically targets a single fact, statistic, definition, or a very narrow aspect of a topic.\n        *   *Good `SEARCH/EXECUTE` examples*: \"Find the 2023 import tariff rate for Chinese-made solar panels in the US.\", \"List the main arguments for the Jones Act.\"\n        *   *Bad `SEARCH/EXECUTE` examples (these should be `SEARCH/PLAN` or broken down)*: \"Research US solar panel tariffs.\", \"Understand the Jones Act.\"\n    *   **Avoiding Over-Fragmentation**: While specificity is key, if multiple *very small, extremely closely related pieces of data* can be retrieved with a single, well-crafted, targeted search query (and an agent can easily parse them), you can group them into one `SEARCH/EXECUTE` task. Example: Instead of three tasks \"Find 2022 EV sales\", \"Find 2023 EV sales\", \"Find 2024 EV sales\", one task \"Find annual US EV sales figures for 2022, 2023, and 2024\" is acceptable if the search agent can handle it. However, do not combine distinct conceptual questions.\n    *   **When to use `SEARCH/PLAN`**: If a research sub-goal still requires investigating multiple *distinct conceptual areas* or is too broad for one or two highly targeted queries (even if slightly grouped as above), that sub-task **MUST** be `task_type: 'SEARCH'` and `node_type: 'PLAN'`. This ensures it gets further decomposed.\n    *   **Example of Balanced Research Breakdown:**\n        *   Initial Broad Goal: \"Write a report on US electric vehicle (EV) adoption.\"\n        *   Planner (Step 1) might create:\n            1. `{\"goal\": \"Research current US EV market penetration statistics (annual sales, market share) for the last 3-5 years.\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"EXECUTE\", \"depends_on_indices\": []}`\n            2. `{\"goal\": \"Identify and summarize key federal and prominent state-level (e.g., CA, NY, TX) government incentives for EV purchases.\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": []}`\n            3. `{\"goal\": \"Investigate primary consumer adoption barriers for EVs (e.g., price, range, charging) based on recent surveys and industry reports.\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": []}`\n            4. `{\"goal\": \"Outline the EV adoption report, incorporating planned research areas.\", \"task_type\": \"THINK\", \"node_type\": \"EXECUTE\", \"depends_on_indices\": [0, 1, 2]}` (Depends on prior research)\n            5. `{\"goal\": \"Write the EV adoption report.\", \"task_type\": \"WRITE\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": [3]}` (Depends on the outline)\n4.  **Node Type Selection (Summary)**:\n    *   Use 'PLAN' if a sub-task requires further decomposition. This includes research goals covering multiple distinct conceptual areas or broad 'WRITE' tasks.\n    *   Prefer 'EXECUTE' for single, well-defined, actionable steps.\n\n**Example 1 (Initial Complex WRITE Goal - Revised for MECE and task limits):**\nInput:\n```json\n{\n  \"current_task_goal\": \"Write a comprehensive report on the recent state of US tariffs.\",\n  \"overall_objective\": \"Produce an publishable analysis of US tariff policy and its impacts.\",\n  \"parent_task_goal\": null,\n  \"planning_depth\": 0,\n  \"execution_history_and_context\": {\n    \"prior_sibling_task_outputs\": [],\n    \"relevant_ancestor_outputs\": [],\n    \"global_knowledge_base_summary\": \"Basic economic principles, trade agreement types.\"\n  },\n  \"replan_request_details\": null,\n  \"global_constraints_or_preferences\": [\"Focus on 2020-present data\"]\n}\n```\nPlanner Output (Revised for 3-6 tasks, MECE, dependencies, and appropriate PLAN nodes):\n```json\n[\n  {\"goal\": \"Identify key US tariff legislation, executive orders, and stated policy aims concerning major trade partners (e.g., China, EU) from 2020-present.\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": []},\n  {\"goal\": \"Gather and synthesize data on the economic impacts of these recent US tariffs, focusing on 2-3 key affected domestic sectors (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture) and overall trade balance figures (2020-present).\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": []},\n  {\"goal\": \"Analyze significant tariff-related disputes and retaliatory actions between the US and its major trade partners (limit to 1-2 key partners like China or EU if too broad) from 2020-present, noting resolutions or ongoing status.\", \"task_type\": \"SEARCH\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": []},\n  {\"goal\": \"Develop a structured outline for the comprehensive tariff report, ensuring logical flow and coverage of findings from the planned research tasks.\", \"task_type\": \"THINK\", \"node_type\": \"EXECUTE\", \"depends_on_indices\": [0, 1, 2]},\n  {\"goal\": \"Draft the comprehensive US tariffs report based on the synthesized research and outline, ensuring clear sections for policy, impacts, and disputes.\", \"task_type\": \"WRITE\", \"node_type\": \"PLAN\", \"depends_on_indices\": [3]}\n]\n```\n\n**Example 2 (Re-plan request due to missing specific research for a WRITE task):**\n\nInput:\n```json\n{\n  \"current_task_goal\": \"Write a detailed history of early US tariffs (1789-1900), analyzing their economic impacts and political contexts.\",\n  \"overall_objective\": \"Complete Chapter 2 of the 'History of US Economic Policy' book.\",\n  \"parent_task_goal\": \"Draft Chapter 2: Early US Economic Policy (1789-1900)\",\n  \"planning_depth\": 1,\n  \"execution_history_and_context\": {\n    \"prior_sibling_task_outputs\": [],\n    \"relevant_ancestor_outputs\": [\n        {\"task_goal\": \"Develop outline for Chapter 2\", \"output_summary\": \"Outline includes section on tariffs, but details are sparse.\"}\n    ],\n    \"global_knowledge_base_summary\": null\n  },\n  \"replan_request_details\": {\n    \"failed_sub_goal\": \"Write a detailed history of early US tariffs (1789-1900), analyzing their economic impacts and political contexts.\",\n    \"reason_for_failure_or_replan\": \"<<NEEDS_REPLAN>> The previous attempt to write this history failed because it lacked specific research data.

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic considerations, and national security concerns. Below is an analysis of key developments from 2018 to the present:\n\n**2018: Introduction of Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**\n\n- **March 2018:** President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. These tariffs initially applied broadly but were later extended to include the European Union, Canada, and Mexico by June 2018. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Exemptions:** Certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, received exemptions. However, these exemptions were later revoked as the administration aimed to close loopholes that were being exploited. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2019-2020: Escalation and Partial Rollbacks**\n\n- **2019:** The U.S. escalated tariffs on Chinese imports under Section 301, targeting various goods in response to alleged unfair trade practices. Some exclusions were granted for specific products, particularly those critical to U.S. industries.\n\n- **2020:** Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) extended exclusions for certain medical supplies and other essential goods to ensure their availability.\n\n**2021-2024: Policy Reviews and Extensions**\n\n- **2021:** The Biden administration initiated a comprehensive review of existing tariffs, maintaining many while assessing their effectiveness. Exclusions for certain products were extended to support industries affected by the pandemic.\n\n- **May 2024:** The USTR extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on 352 Chinese imports and 77 pandemic-related categories until June 14, 2024, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. This decision aimed to facilitate sourcing shifts and address limited availability outside China. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2025: Renewed Tariff Actions and Policy Shifts**\n\n- **February 2025:** President Trump reinstated and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25% and eliminating previous exemptions and quotas. This move aimed to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices and global excess capacity. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **March 2025:** The administration imposed a 25% tariff on all automobile imports, with exemptions for vehicles meeting U.S. content thresholds and those compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ([richmondfed.org](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-15?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **April 2025:** A 90-day pause on broad tariffs was announced, providing temporary relief to certain trading partners. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were significantly increased to 125%, reflecting a hardened stance toward Beijing. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **May 2025:** The administration further escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the cumulative rate to as high as 245%. This unprecedented increase included a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% penalty tariff related to the fentanyl crisis, and additional Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on specific goods. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind Changes**\n\nThe adjustments in U.S. tariff policies have been driven by several factors:\n\n- **National Security:** Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and certain technology products were justified on grounds of protecting critical industries vital to national defense.\n\n- **Economic Strategy:** The administration aimed to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic manufacturing by making imported goods more expensive.\n\n- **Trade Negotiations:** Tariffs served as leverage in negotiations with trading partners to secure more favorable trade agreements and address issues like intellectual property theft and market access.\n\n- **Public Health:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, exclusions were granted to ensure the availability of essential medical supplies.\n\nThese policy shifts reflect the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the U.S. government's strategic use of tariffs to address various economic and security concerns.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Will Trump's tariff climbdown save the US from recession?](https://www.ft.com/content/b27e769f-3266-4803-9128-ec7e6d635a2c?utm_source=openai)\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai) \n\n--- End Child Task Result 1 ---\n\n--- Child Task Result 2 (Source: 'root.1.2', Goal: Research and analyze significant changes, exemptions, or reversals to U.S. tariff policies that have...) ---\n\nSince the initial implementation of U.S. tariffs in 2018, there have been numerous significant changes, exemptions, and reversals in tariff policies. These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic strategies, and geopolitical considerations. Below is an analysis of key developments from 2018 to the present:\n\n**2018: Initiation of Tariffs and Early Exemptions**\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**: In March 2018, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. Initially, these tariffs applied broadly but were later extended to include the European Union, Canada, and Mexico by June 2018. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Exemptions and Retaliation**: Certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, were initially exempted from these tariffs. However, these exemptions were revoked in June 2018, leading to retaliatory tariffs from affected nations. For instance, the EU imposed levies on $2.8 billion worth of U.S. imports, targeting products like bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, and jeans. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2019: Adjustments and Trade Agreements**\n\n- **Lifting of Tariffs on Canada and Mexico**: In May 2019, the U.S. reached agreements to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This move was aimed at facilitating the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2024: Escalation of Tariffs under the Biden Administration**\n\n- **Increased Tariffs on Chinese Goods**: In May 2024, the Biden administration significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Tariffs on electric vehicles were raised to 100%, solar cells to 50%, and electric vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, and aluminum to 25%. These increases were phased in over three years, with full implementation by September 2024. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2025: Renewed Tariff Policies in the Second Trump Administration**\n\n- **Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs**: In April 2025, President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting specific countries were introduced, including a 34% tariff on Chinese imports and 20% on European Union goods. Canada and Mexico were exempt from these additional tariffs due to existing trade agreements. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Suspension and Escalation**: On April 9, 2025, a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs was announced, except for those on China. Concurrently, tariffs on Chinese imports were increased from 34% to 125%, reflecting a hardened stance toward Beijing. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **De Minimis Exemption Revocation**: In April 2025, the Trump administration moved to revoke the \"de minimis\" tariff exemption for low-value shipments from China. This exemption had allowed goods worth under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, a method extensively used by Chinese e-commerce companies. The revocation aimed to address concerns over trade imbalances and national security. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/trump-considering-revoking-tariff-exemptions-cheap-shipments-china-source-says-2025-04-02/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\nThe modifications in U.S. tariff policies since 2018 have been driven by several factors:\n\n- **National Security Concerns**: Tariffs on steel and aluminum were justified on the grounds of protecting domestic industries critical to national security.\n\n- **Trade Imbalances**: Efforts to reduce trade deficits, particularly with China, have led to increased tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n- **Economic Strategy**: The use of tariffs has been a tool to encourage domestic manufacturing and to negotiate more favorable trade agreements.\n\n- **Retaliatory Measures**: Responses from trading partners to U.S. tariffs have influenced subsequent policy adjustments and exemptions.\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of U.S. trade policy, reflecting a balance between protecting domestic industries, addressing trade deficits, and managing international relations.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [What's Happening With Trump Tariffs?

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic strategies, and geopolitical considerations. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**1. Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**\n\n- **Initial Implementation (2018):** In March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns.\n\n- **Exemptions and Lifting of Tariffs (2019):** By May 2019, the U.S. reached agreements to lift these tariffs on Canada and Mexico, facilitating the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Reinstatement and Increase (2025):** In March 2025, the U.S. reinstated the 25% tariff on steel imports and increased the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%. This action revoked previous exemptions and expanded tariffs to cover key downstream products. ([linklaters.com](https://www.linklaters.com/en/knowledge/publications/alerts-newsletters-and-guides/2025/april/15/navigating-the-storm-us-tariff-hikes-and-managing-the-impact?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. Tariffs on Chinese Imports**\n\n- **Section 301 Tariffs (2018-2019):** Between 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on approximately $250 billion worth of Chinese goods under Section 301, addressing concerns over intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\n\n- **Phase One Trade Deal (2020):** In December 2019, the U.S. postponed a planned 15% tariff on $160 billion of Chinese goods and agreed to reduce existing tariffs as part of the \"phase one\" trade deal, which took effect in February 2020. ([mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/international-trade-investment/959030/market-trends-201920-us-tariff-policies?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Tariff Increases (2025):** In April 2025, the U.S. significantly escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the cumulative rate to as high as 245%. This increase included a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% penalty tariff related to the fentanyl crisis, and additional Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on specific goods. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs**\n\n- **Introduction (April 2025):** President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting specific countries commenced on April 9, 2025, including a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, 20% on European Union goods, and 24% on Japanese products. Canada and Mexico were exempt from these additional tariffs due to existing trade agreements. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Adjustments (April 2025):** Shortly after implementation, the U.S. paused the reciprocal tariff increases for most countries for 90 days, maintaining the 10% universal tariff. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised from 34% to 125%, marking the most aggressive tariff policy to date under the new trade agenda. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. De Minimis Exemption Adjustments**\n\n- **Closure for China and Hong Kong (May 2025):** The U.S. closed the de minimis exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025. This exemption previously allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without standard customs procedures. Imports shipped via the Universal Postal Union became subject to a duty of 120% of the shipment's value or $100 per package, increasing to $200 after June 1, 2025. Shipments by other carriers became subject to all applicable standard duties, with a minimum of 145% for Chinese goods.

Tariffs on Automobiles and Auto Parts**\n\n- **Implementation (April-May 2025):** In March 2025, the U.S. announced a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, effective April 3, 2025. Key automobile parts, including engines and transmissions, were also subjected to this tariff, with potential expansions to additional components. ([linklaters.com](https://www.linklaters.com/en/knowledge/publications/alerts-newsletters-and-guides/2025/april/15/navigating-the-storm-us-tariff-hikes-and-managing-the-impact?utm_source=openai))\n\n**6. Exemptions and Extensions**\n\n- **Chinese Tariff Exclusions (2024):** In May 2024, the U.S. Trade Representative extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on 352 Chinese imports and 77 pandemic-related categories until June 14, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. Items retaining exclusions included machinery, motors, and medical equipment, while products like garage-door openers and electric motorcycles saw tariffs reinstated. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\n- **National Security:** Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and certain technology products were justified on the grounds of protecting national security and reducing dependence on foreign materials.\n\n- **Economic Strategy:** The U.S. aimed to bolster domestic manufacturing, address trade imbalances, and respond to perceived unfair trade practices by imposing and adjusting tariffs.\n\n- **Geopolitical Considerations:** Tariff policies were also influenced by broader geopolitical strategies, including addressing issues related to intellectual property theft, the fentanyl crisis, and maintaining leverage in trade negotiations.\n\nThese developments reflect the dynamic nature of U.S. trade policy, characterized by strategic adjustments in response to domestic economic goals and international trade dynamics.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump steps up his 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum, risking inflation on promise of more jobs](https://apnews.com/article/0a91ceaf3aa3c1756c339817d1d58076?utm_source=openai)\n- [USTR extends some Chinese tariff exclusions, but many to fall away](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai) \n\n--- End Child Task Result 3 ---\n\n--- Child Task Result 4 (Source: 'root.1.4', Goal: Research and analyze significant changes, exemptions, or reversals to U.S. tariff policies that have...) ---\n\nSince the initial implementation of U.S. tariffs in 2018, there have been numerous significant changes, exemptions, and reversals in tariff policies. These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relations, economic considerations, and national security concerns. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**1. Section 301 Tariffs on Chinese Imports**\n\n- **Initial Implementation (2018-2019):** The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, targeting unfair trade practices.\n\n- **Exemptions and Extensions (2024):** In May 2024, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) extended exclusions for 352 Chinese imports and 77 COVID-19-related products until June 14, 2024, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. These exclusions included items like machinery, motors, and medical equipment. However, products such as garage-door openers and electric motorcycles saw tariffs reinstated. The extensions aimed to facilitate sourcing shifts and address limited availability outside China. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. Section 232 Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum**\n\n- **Initial Tariffs (2018):** The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns.\n\n- **Exemptions and Quotas (2018-2019):** Countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom negotiated exemptions, quotas, or tariff-rate quotas. For instance, Canada and Mexico had exemptions subject to informal agreements to manage export volumes. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/president-trump-expands-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-all-countries-effective-march-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Revocation of Exemptions (2025):** On February 10, 2025, President Trump revoked existing country- and product-specific exclusions from the steel and aluminum tariffs. This action terminated special arrangements with countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine, and the UK. The changes took effect on March 12, 2025. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/president-trump-expands-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-all-countries-effective-march-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Tariffs on Chinese Electronics**\n\n- **Exemptions (2025):** In April 2025, the Trump administration announced exemptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, routers, and specific computers, from steep reciprocal tariffs. This move aimed to alleviate immediate price hikes on products not typically manufactured in the U.S. However, officials indicated that these exemptions were temporary and subject to re-evaluation, particularly concerning semiconductors. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3eb48a07-7cb0-4a44-9159-eb5b402c2fec?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. De Minimis Exemption for Low-Value Packages**\n\n- **Closure of Exemption (2025):** In May 2025, the Trump administration ended the de minimis tariff exemption for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong. This change subjected all shipments from these regions to new tariffs, including a 145% tariff plus any previous duties. The policy targeted shipments potentially containing illegal substances, such as fentanyl. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-low-value-package-tariff-exemption-ends-questions-remain-over-us-2025-05-02/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Reciprocal Tariff Policy and Temporary Suspensions**\n\n- **Implementation and Suspension (2025):** On April 9, 2025, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on broad tariffs recently imposed on key U.S. trading partners, except for China, where tariffs were increased to 125%. This pause aimed to alleviate immediate concerns and signal a temporary easing in trade tensions. However, the administration maintained a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with exemptions for items like chips, pharmaceuticals, and energy. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\n- **Economic Considerations:** Adjustments were often made to mitigate adverse effects on U.S. industries and consumers, such as preventing price hikes on essential goods or addressing supply chain disruptions.\n\n- **Trade Negotiations:** Exemptions and extensions served as tools in broader trade negotiations, aiming to secure favorable terms or concessions from trading partners.\n\n- **National Security:** Some tariff policies, especially those under Section 232, were justified on national security grounds, aiming to protect domestic industries critical to national defense.\n\n- **Political Strategy:** Tariff adjustments were also influenced by political considerations, including responses to domestic and international pressures, as well as strategic positioning in trade disputes.\n\nIn summary, U.S. tariff policies since 2018 have undergone significant modifications, reflecting a complex interplay of economic, security, and political factors. These changes underscore the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the multifaceted considerations influencing tariff decisions.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)\n- [USTR extends some Chinese tariff exclusions, but many to fall away](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump exempts smartphones from 'reciprocal' tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/3eb48a07-7cb0-4a44-9159-eb5b402c2fec?utm_source=openai) \n\n--- End Child Task Result 4 ---\n\n--- Child Task Result 5 (Source: 'root.1.5', Goal: Compile, organize, and synthesize the research findings from completed sub-tasks on U.S. trade tarif...) ---\n\n# U.S. Trade Tariffs (2018-Present): Comprehensive Analysis\n\n## Timeline of Implementation\n\n### Trump Administration (2018-2021)\n- **January 2018**: First major tariffs on washing machines (up to 50%) and solar panels (30%)\n- **March 2018**: 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum under Section 232 national security concerns\n- **June-September 2018**: Three rounds of tariffs on Chinese goods under Section 301:\n  -

      "full_result": "# The Economic Impacts of Recent U.S. Tariffs on the Global Economy\n\n## Global Trade Flow Disruptions\n\nThe implementation of U.S. tariffs since 2018 has significantly altered global trade flows, creating ripple effects across the international economy. U.S.-China bilateral trade has experienced particularly dramatic shifts, with Chinese exports to the U.S. declining by approximately 25% between 2018 and 2019 following the implementation of Section 301 tariffs ([Peterson Institute for International Economics](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide)). This decline represents a substantial reversal from the steady growth observed in previous decades, highlighting the immediate impact of tariff policies on established trade relationships.\n\nThe imposition of tariffs has led to a contraction in global trade flows, with estimates indicating a reduction between 5.5% and 8.5% relative to pre-tariff levels. Trade involving global value chains (GVCs)\u2014shipments crossing multiple borders before reaching consumers\u2014has been particularly impacted, shrinking by approximately 2 percentage points more than direct bilateral trade. Sectors such as transport equipment and electrical equipment and electronics have experienced declines of 16% and 12%, respectively, under scenarios involving full tariff implementation and retaliatory measures. ([cepr.org](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/roaring-tariffs-global-impact-2025-us-trade-war?utm_source=openai))\n\nU.S. imports from China have plummeted by about 90% due to comprehensive tariffs, while imports from Canada and Mexico have decreased by roughly 30%. Conversely, imports from the United Kingdom have seen a modest increase, as UK goods have been largely exempt from the new tariffs. In response, China has redirected its exports toward other markets, with exports to the Eurozone and the UK increasing by around 9%. Notably, Chinese goods have increasingly entered the U.S. indirectly through countries like Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adaptability of global supply chains. ([cepr.org](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/roaring-tariffs-global-impact-2025-us-trade-war?utm_source=openai))\n\nAs trade patterns adjusted to these new barriers, significant trade diversion occurred. Countries including Vietnam, Mexico, and Taiwan emerged as alternative suppliers to the U.S. market, with Vietnam's exports to the U.S. increasing by over 35% in 2019 alone ([U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/index.html)). This shift demonstrates how tariff policies can rapidly reconfigure global supply chains, creating both winners and losers in the international trade landscape.\n\nGlobal trade volumes overall experienced a notable slowdown, with the WTO revising its global trade growth forecasts downward multiple times between 2018 and 2020, citing trade tensions as a primary factor ([World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news19_e/wtoi_25feb19_e.htm)). The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these trade disruptions, making it challenging to isolate the specific impacts of tariff policies versus pandemic-related factors in more recent data.\n\n## Major Affected Sectors\n\nSeveral key sectors have been particularly impacted by the tariff policies:\n\n- **Consumer Electronics and Electrical Machinery**: Tariffs have added substantial costs to importing these products from China into the U.S., with a 60% tariff rate estimated to add $61 billion to the cost of importing consumer electronics. ([bcg.com](https://www.bcg.com/press/13january2025-landmark-shifts-global-trade-flows?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Automotive Industry**: Increased tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports threaten North American vehicle assembly operations, potentially raising consumer prices and reducing competitiveness. ([dairynews.today](https://dairynews.today/news/the-global-trade-war-intensifies-economic-ramifications-of-u-s-tariff-policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Pharmaceuticals**: The sector faces rising drug costs due to tariffs affecting cross-border supply chains for active ingredients and production facilities, impacting healthcare affordability. ([dairynews.today](https://dairynews.today/news/the-global-trade-war-intensifies-economic-ramifications-of-u-s-tariff-policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Semiconductors**: Tariffs could stifle innovation and intensify geopolitical competition in technology, particularly between the U.S. and China. ([dairynews.today](https://dairynews.today/news/the-global-trade-war-intensifies-economic-ramifications-of-u-s-tariff-policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n## Domestic Economic Effects in the United States\n\n### Manufacturing Sector Impacts\n\nThe manufacturing sector in the United States has experienced mixed outcomes from tariff policies. While some protected industries saw modest employment gains, these benefits were often outweighed by broader negative effects. For instance, studies indicate that U.S. steel tariffs may have saved approximately 1,000 steel jobs, but at a cost of roughly $900,000 per job saved when accounting for higher input costs across the economy ([American Action Forum](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-total-cost-of-u-s-tariffs/)). \n\nAmerican manufacturers that rely on imported inputs faced significant cost increases, with many reporting reduced profit margins and competitive challenges. A Federal Reserve study found that U.S. manufacturing employment actually declined slightly in industries more exposed to tariff increases on inputs, contradicting the job creation narrative ([Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf)). This highlights the complex interplay between protectionist policies and their actual outcomes for the sectors they aim to support.\n\n### Consumer Price Effects\n\nAmerican consumers have borne a substantial portion of the tariff burden through higher prices. Economic analyses consistently show that nearly 100% of tariff costs have been passed on to U.S. buyers rather than being absorbed by foreign exporters ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25672)). The inflationary impact has been particularly noticeable in categories directly affected by tariffs, such as washing machines, which saw price increases of approximately 12% following the implementation of specific tariffs on these products ([University of Chicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-production-relocation-and-price-effects-of-us-trade-policy-the-case-of-washing-machines/)).\n\nThese price increases have disproportionately affected lower-income households, who typically spend a larger percentage of their income on goods affected by tariffs. Studies estimate that the average American household faced additional costs of $831 annually due to tariff-induced price increases ([Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trump-trade-war/)), representing a regressive form of taxation that has received limited public attention.\n\n## U.S. Tariff Policy Evolution (2018-Present)\n\n### Major Policy Implementation Phases\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs (March 2018):** The Trump administration imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Solar Panels and Washing Machines (January 2018):** Tariffs were imposed on imported solar panels and washing machines to protect domestic industries. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Exemptions and Trade Agreements\n\n- **USMCA Agreement (May 2019):** The U.S. lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico, facilitating the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Policy Adjustments and Reviews\n\n- **Section 301 Tariffs on China:** Tariffs on Chinese goods remained in place, with periodic reviews and extensions of product exclusions. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/ustr-extends-china-section-301-tariff-exclusions-while-four-year-review-continues?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Solar Panel Tariffs Extension (February 2022):** The Biden administration extended tariffs on solar panels for four years, with temporary exemptions for imports from certain Southeast Asian countries. ([votetomrice.com](https://votetomrice.com/article/tariff-tracker-tracking-the-economic-impact-of-tariffs?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Section 301 Exclusions (December 2023):** The U.S. Trade Representative extended exclusions for 352 Chinese imports and 77 COVID-related products until May 31, 2024, to support domestic industries and supply chains. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/ustr-extends-china-section-301-tariff-exclusions-while-four-year-review-continues?utm_source=openai))\n\n### Recent Developments (2025)\n\n- **Restoration of Section 232 Tariffs (February 2025):** President Trump reinstated a 25% tariff on steel and increased the aluminum tariff to 25%, citing national security concerns and aiming to protect domestic industries. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Universal Tariff Regime (April 2025):** A 10% universal tariff on all imports was announced, with higher rates for specific countries, including a 34% tariff on Chinese goods and a 20% tariff on EU imports, to address trade imbalances and protect domestic industries. ([ashurst.com](https://www.ashurst.com/en/insights/the-impact-of-the-new-wave-of-us-tariffs-on-global-businesses/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Tariff Pause and Adjustments (April 2025):** A 90-day pause on broad tariffs was implemented, while tariffs on China were increased from 104% to 125%, reflecting a strategic shift in trade policy. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n## International Economic Repercussions\n\n### Retaliatory Tariffs and Their Impact\n\nIn response to U.S. tariff actions, multiple trading partners implemented retaliatory measures, creating a cascading effect of trade barriers. China's countermeasures targeted $110 billion in U.S. exports, particularly focusing on agricultural products like soybeans, where exports to China fell by over 70% in 2018 ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/95700/eib-215.pdf)). The European Union, Canada, and Mexico also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth approximately $20 billion combined ([Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45249)).\n\nThese retaliatory measures created targeted economic pain in specific U.S. sectors and regions, often with political calculations in mind. For instance, the EU strategically targeted products from politically sensitive states, including bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles from Wisconsin ([European Commission](https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1868)). This international response demonstrates how tariff conflicts can quickly escalate into broader trade wars with multiplied economic costs.\n\n### Global Supply Chain Restructuring\n\nThe prolonged nature of tariff disputes has triggered significant restructuring of global supply chains, with companies seeking to mitigate tariff exposure through geographic diversification. A 2020 survey found that 82% of multinational firms were engaged in supply chain reorganization efforts, with tariff concerns cited as a primary motivation ([Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/operations-performance-transformation/us-reshoring-index)). \n\nThis restructuring has accelerated existing trends toward reduced dependence on China, benefiting alternative manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia and Mexico. However, these shifts involve substantial transition costs and inefficiencies. Companies report spending an average of 18 months and millions of dollars to relocate production facilities ([U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/international/trade-tariffs/tariffs-trade-barriers)), costs that are ultimately reflected in reduced investment, employment, or higher consumer prices.\n\n## Sectoral Analysis\n\n### Agricultural Sector\n\nU.S. agricultural exports have been particularly vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs, with American farmers experiencing severe market disruptions. Soybean exports, previously America's largest agricultural export to China, declined by over 70% in the year following Chinese retaliatory tariffs ([American Farm Bureau Federation](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-exports-to-china-down-sharply)). The U.S. government responded with unprecedented agricultural subsidies totaling over $28 billion between 2018 and 2020 to offset farmers' losses ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/05/23/usda-announces-support-farmers-impacted-unjustified-retaliation-and)).\n\nThese subsidies, while providing temporary relief, have raised concerns about long-term market distortions and dependency. Moreover, evidence suggests that American farmers have lost market share in key export markets that may prove difficult to recover even if tariffs are eventually removed ([International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-retaliatory-tariffs-agricultural-and-food-trade)).\n\n### Technology and Advanced Manufacturing\n\nThe technology sector has faced particular challenges from tariffs and related trade restrictions, with both hardware and software companies reporting disrupted supply chains and increased costs. Computer and electronics manufacturers experienced input cost increases averaging 3-8% due to tariffs on components ([Information Technology Industry Council](https://www.itic.org/policy/trade/ITITariffImpactStudy.pdf)), costs that were difficult to absorb or pass along in the competitive global technology marketplace.\n\nBeyond direct tariff impacts, technology companies have also navigated an increasingly complex landscape of export controls and investment restrictions that have accompanied trade tensions. These measures have particularly affected advanced sectors like semiconductor manufacturing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, where global innovation ecosystems have been fragmented along geopolitical lines ([Semiconductor Industry Association](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SIA-Impact-of-US-Export-Controls-on-the-Semiconductor-Industry.pdf)).\n\n## Macroeconomic Indicators and Uncertainty Effects\n\nThe cumulative effect of tariff policies on broader economic indicators has been measurable but mixed with other factors. Studies estimate that tariff actions reduced U.S. GDP growth by approximately 0.23-0.30 percentage points annually during peak implementation ([Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55576)), while increasing producer price inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage points ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households/)).\n\nThe escalation of tariffs has introduced significant uncertainty into global markets, leading to volatility in equity, currency, and fixed income markets. Investors are wary of prolonged economic uncertainty, fearing that continued protectionist policies could trigger a broader economic downturn. ([dairynews.today](https://dairynews.today/news/the-global-trade-war-intensifies-economic-ramifications-of-u-s-tariff-policies.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nThe frequent changes, exemptions, and reversals in U.S. tariff policies have created a climate of economic uncertainty that has affected business investment and planning. Policy uncertainty indices reached record levels during periods of active tariff escalation ([Economic Policy Uncertainty Index](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/trade_uncertainty.html)), correlating with reduced capital expenditures among publicly traded companies ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27114)).\n\nThis uncertainty effect extends beyond directly affected industries, as businesses throughout the economy have factored potential trade policy changes into their risk assessments. Survey data indicates that over 40% of manufacturing firms delayed or reconsidered investment decisions specifically due to trade policy uncertainty between 2018 and 2020 ([National Association of Manufacturers](https://www.nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NAM-Q2-2019-Manufacturers-Outlook-Survey.pdf)), suggesting that the indirect costs of policy volatility may be as economically significant as the direct costs of the tariffs themselves.\n\nGlobal economic growth also showed sensitivity to trade tensions, with the IMF citing tariff uncertainties as a key factor in downgrading global growth projections multiple times between 2018 and 2020 ([International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019)). These macroeconomic effects, while significant, have been partially obscured by other major economic events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced unprecedented disruptions to global trade and economic activity beginning in early 2020.\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies and Global Trade:\n- [How Trump's Tariff Unpredictability Hurts Businesses and Consumers-and Could Help China](https://time.com/7286933/trump-trade-war-us-china-tariff-pause-businesses-costs-uncertainty/?utm_source=openai)\n- [ECB's Escriva sees risks to global financial sector from U.S. trade policies](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/ecbs-escriva-sees-risks-global-financial-sector-us-trade-policies-2025-05-20/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Tariff math leaves retailers very little choice on prices](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/21/tariffs-prices-kids-shoes?utm_source=openai)\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Will Trump's tariff climbdown save the US from recession?](https://www.ft.com/content/b27e769f-3266-4803-9128-ec7e6d635a2c?utm_source=openai)\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)",

Conversely, imports from the United Kingdom have seen a modest increase, as UK goods have been largely exempt from the new tariffs. In response, China has redirected its exports toward other markets, with exports to the Eurozone and the UK increasing by around 9%. Notably, Chinese goods have increasingly entered the U.S. indirectly through countries like Mexico and Canada, highlighting the adaptability of global supply chains.

U.S.-China bilateral trade has experienced particularly dramatic shifts, with Chinese exports to the U.S. declining by approximately 25% between 2018 and 2019 following the implementation of Section 301 tariffs ([Peterson Institute for International Economics](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide)). This decline represents a substantial reversal from the steady growth observed in previous decades, highlighting the immediate impact of tariff policies on established trade relationships.\n\nAs trade patterns adjusted to these new barriers, significant trade diversion occurred. Countries including Vietnam, Mexico, and Taiwan emerged as alternative suppliers to the U.S. market, with Vietnam's exports to the U.S. increasing by over 35% in 2019 alone ([U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/index.html)). This shift demonstrates how tariff policies can rapidly reconfigure global supply chains, creating both winners and losers in the international trade landscape.\n\nGlobal trade volumes overall experienced a notable slowdown, with the WTO revising its global trade growth forecasts downward multiple times between 2018 and 2020, citing trade tensions as a primary factor ([World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news19_e/wtoi_25feb19_e.htm)). The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these trade disruptions, making it challenging to isolate the specific impacts of tariff policies versus pandemic-related factors in more recent data.\n\n## Domestic Economic Effects in the United States\n\n### Manufacturing Sector Impacts\n\nThe manufacturing sector in the United States has experienced mixed outcomes from tariff policies. While some protected industries saw modest employment gains, these benefits were often outweighed by broader negative effects. For instance, studies indicate that U.S. steel tariffs may have saved approximately 1,000 steel jobs, but at a cost of roughly $900,000 per job saved when accounting for higher input costs across the economy ([American Action Forum](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-total-cost-of-u-s-tariffs/)). \n\nAmerican manufacturers that rely on imported inputs faced significant cost increases, with many reporting reduced profit margins and competitive challenges. A Federal Reserve study found that U.S. manufacturing employment actually declined slightly in industries more exposed to tariff increases on inputs, contradicting the job creation narrative ([Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf)). This highlights the complex interplay between protectionist policies and their actual outcomes for the sectors they aim to support.\n\n### Consumer Price Effects\n\nAmerican consumers have borne a substantial portion of the tariff burden through higher prices. Economic analyses consistently show that nearly 100% of tariff costs have been passed on to U.S. buyers rather than being absorbed by foreign exporters ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25672)). The inflationary impact has been particularly noticeable in categories directly affected by tariffs, such as washing machines, which saw price increases of approximately 12% following the implementation of specific tariffs on these products ([University of Chicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-production-relocation-and-price-effects-of-us-trade-policy-the-case-of-washing-machines/)).\n\nThese price increases have disproportionately affected lower-income households, who typically spend a larger percentage of their income on goods affected by tariffs. Studies estimate that the average American household faced additional costs of $831 annually due to tariff-induced price increases ([Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trump-trade-war/)), representing a regressive form of taxation that has received limited public attention.\n\n## International Economic Repercussions\n\n### Retaliatory Tariffs and Their Impact\n\nIn response to U.S. tariff actions, multiple trading partners implemented retaliatory measures, creating a cascading effect of trade barriers. China's countermeasures targeted $110 billion in U.S. exports, particularly focusing on agricultural products like soybeans, where exports to China fell by over 70% in 2018 ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/95700/eib-215.pdf)). The European Union, Canada, and Mexico also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth approximately $20 billion combined ([Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45249)).\n\nThese retaliatory measures created targeted economic pain in specific U.S. sectors and regions, often with political calculations in mind. For instance, the EU strategically targeted products from politically sensitive states, including bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles from Wisconsin ([European Commission](https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1868)). This international response demonstrates how tariff conflicts can quickly escalate into broader trade wars with multiplied economic costs.\n\n### Global Supply Chain Restructuring\n\nThe prolonged nature of tariff disputes has triggered significant restructuring of global supply chains, with companies seeking to mitigate tariff exposure through geographic diversification. A 2020 survey found that 82% of multinational firms were engaged in supply chain reorganization efforts, with tariff concerns cited as a primary motivation ([Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/operations-performance-transformation/us-reshoring-index)). \n\nThis restructuring has accelerated existing trends toward reduced dependence on China, benefiting alternative manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia and Mexico. However, these shifts involve substantial transition costs and inefficiencies. Companies report spending an average of 18 months and millions of dollars to relocate production facilities ([U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/international/trade-tariffs/tariffs-trade-barriers)), costs that are ultimately reflected in reduced investment, employment, or higher consumer prices.\n\n## Sectoral Analysis\n\n### Agricultural Sector\n\nU.S. agricultural exports have been particularly vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs, with American farmers experiencing severe market disruptions. Soybean exports, previously America's largest agricultural export to China, declined by over 70% in the year following Chinese retaliatory tariffs ([American Farm Bureau Federation](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-exports-to-china-down-sharply)). The U.S. government responded with unprecedented agricultural subsidies totaling over $28 billion between 2018 and 2020 to offset farmers' losses ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/05/23/usda-announces-support-farmers-impacted-unjustified-retaliation-and)).\n\nThese subsidies, while providing temporary relief, have raised concerns about long-term market distortions and dependency. Moreover, evidence suggests that American farmers have lost market share in key export markets that may prove difficult to recover even if tariffs are eventually removed ([International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-retaliatory-tariffs-agricultural-and-food-trade)).\n\n### Technology and Advanced Manufacturing\n\nThe technology sector has faced particular challenges from tariffs and related trade restrictions, with both hardware and software companies reporting disrupted supply chains and increased costs. Computer and electronics manufacturers experienced input cost increases averaging 3-8% due to tariffs on components ([Information Technology Industry Council](https://www.itic.org/policy/trade/ITITariffImpactStudy.pdf)), costs that were difficult to absorb or pass along in the competitive global technology marketplace.\n\nBeyond direct tariff impacts, technology companies have also navigated an increasingly complex landscape of export controls and investment restrictions that have accompanied trade tensions. These measures have particularly affected advanced sectors like semiconductor manufacturing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, where global innovation ecosystems have been fragmented along geopolitical lines ([Semiconductor Industry Association](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SIA-Impact-of-US-Export-Controls-on-the-Semiconductor-Industry.pdf)).\n\n## Macroeconomic Indicators\n\nThe cumulative effect of tariff policies on broader economic indicators has been measurable but mixed with other factors. Studies estimate that tariff actions reduced U.S. GDP growth by approximately 0.23-0.30 percentage points annually during peak implementation ([Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55576)), while increasing producer price inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage points ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households/)).\n\nGlobal economic growth also showed sensitivity to trade tensions, with the IMF citing tariff uncertainties as a key factor in downgrading global growth projections multiple times between 2018 and 2020 ([International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019)). These macroeconomic effects, while significant, have been partially obscured by other major economic events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced unprecedented disruptions to global trade and economic activity beginning in early 2020.\n\n## Policy Evolution and Uncertainty Effects\n\nThe frequent changes, exemptions, and reversals in U.S. tariff policies have created a climate of economic uncertainty that has affected business investment and planning. Policy uncertainty indices reached record levels during periods of active tariff escalation ([Economic Policy Uncertainty Index](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/trade_uncertainty.html)), correlating with reduced capital expenditures among publicly traded companies ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27114)).\n\nThis uncertainty effect extends beyond directly affected industries, as businesses throughout the economy have factored potential trade policy changes into their risk assessments. Survey data indicates that over 40% of manufacturing firms delayed or reconsidered investment decisions specifically due to trade policy uncertainty between 2018 and 2020 ([National Association of Manufacturers](https://www.nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NAM-Q2-2019-Manufacturers-Outlook-Survey.pdf)), suggesting that the indirect costs of policy volatility may be as economically significant as the direct costs of the tariffs themselves.\n\n--- End Child Task Result 6 ---",

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic considerations, and national security concerns. Below is an analysis of key developments from 2018 to the present:\n\n**2018: Introduction of Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**\n\n- **March 2018:** President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. These tariffs initially applied broadly but were later extended to include the European Union, Canada, and Mexico by June 2018. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Exemptions:** Certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, received exemptions. However, these exemptions were later revoked as the administration aimed to close loopholes that were being exploited. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2019-2020: Escalation and Partial Rollbacks**\n\n- **2019:** The U.S. escalated tariffs on Chinese imports under Section 301, targeting various goods in response to alleged unfair trade practices. Some exclusions were granted for specific products, particularly those critical to U.S. industries.\n\n- **2020:** Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) extended exclusions for certain medical supplies and other essential goods to ensure their availability.\n\n**2021-2024: Policy Reviews and Extensions**\n\n- **2021:** The Biden administration initiated a comprehensive review of existing tariffs, maintaining many while assessing their effectiveness. Exclusions for certain products were extended to support industries affected by the pandemic.\n\n- **May 2024:** The USTR extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on 352 Chinese imports and 77 pandemic-related categories until June 14, 2024, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. This decision aimed to facilitate sourcing shifts and address limited availability outside China. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2025: Renewed Tariff Actions and Policy Shifts**\n\n- **February 2025:** President Trump reinstated and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25% and eliminating previous exemptions and quotas. This move aimed to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices and global excess capacity. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-restores-section-232-tariffs/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **March 2025:** The administration imposed a 25% tariff on all automobile imports, with exemptions for vehicles meeting U.S. content thresholds and those compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ([richmondfed.org](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2025/eb_25-15?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **April 2025:** A 90-day pause on broad tariffs was announced, providing temporary relief to certain trading partners. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were significantly increased to 125%, reflecting a hardened stance toward Beijing. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **May 2025:** The administration further escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the cumulative rate to as high as 245%. This unprecedented increase included a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% penalty tariff related to the fentanyl crisis, and additional Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on specific goods. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind Changes**\n\nThe adjustments in U.S. tariff policies have been driven by several factors:\n\n- **National Security:** Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and certain technology products were justified on grounds of protecting critical industries vital to national defense.\n\n- **Economic Strategy:** The administration aimed to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic manufacturing by making imported goods more expensive.\n\n- **Trade Negotiations:** Tariffs served as leverage in negotiations with trading partners to secure more favorable trade agreements and address issues like intellectual property theft and market access.\n\n- **Public Health:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, exclusions were granted to ensure the availability of essential medical supplies.\n\nThese policy shifts reflect the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the U.S. government's strategic use of tariffs to address various economic and security concerns.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Will Trump's tariff climbdown save the US from recession?](https://www.ft.com/content/b27e769f-3266-4803-9128-ec7e6d635a2c?utm_source=openai)\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai) ",

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic strategies, and geopolitical considerations. Below is an analysis of key developments from 2018 to the present:\n\n**2018: Initiation of Tariffs and Early Exemptions**\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**: In March 2018, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. Initially, these tariffs applied broadly but were later extended to include the European Union, Canada, and Mexico by June 2018. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Exemptions and Retaliation**: Certain countries, including Canada and Mexico, were initially exempted from these tariffs. However, these exemptions were revoked in June 2018, leading to retaliatory tariffs from affected nations. For instance, the EU imposed levies on $2.8 billion worth of U.S. imports, targeting products like bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, and jeans. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/c41c54d0-f2b1-4450-9b94-b6a3db8e6cc9?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2019: Adjustments and Trade Agreements**\n\n- **Lifting of Tariffs on Canada and Mexico**: In May 2019, the U.S. reached agreements to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico. This move was aimed at facilitating the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2024: Escalation of Tariffs under the Biden Administration**\n\n- **Increased Tariffs on Chinese Goods**: In May 2024, the Biden administration significantly increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Tariffs on electric vehicles were raised to 100%, solar cells to 50%, and electric vehicle batteries, critical minerals, steel, and aluminum to 25%. These increases were phased in over three years, with full implementation by September 2024. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2025: Renewed Tariff Policies in the Second Trump Administration**\n\n- **Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs**: In April 2025, President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting specific countries were introduced, including a 34% tariff on Chinese imports and 20% on European Union goods. Canada and Mexico were exempt from these additional tariffs due to existing trade agreements. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Suspension and Escalation**: On April 9, 2025, a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs was announced, except for those on China. Concurrently, tariffs on Chinese imports were increased from 34% to 125%, reflecting a hardened stance toward Beijing. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **De Minimis Exemption Revocation**: In April 2025, the Trump administration moved to revoke the \"de minimis\" tariff exemption for low-value shipments from China. This exemption had allowed goods worth under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, a method extensively used by Chinese e-commerce companies. The revocation aimed to address concerns over trade imbalances and national security. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/trump-considering-revoking-tariff-exemptions-cheap-shipments-china-source-says-2025-04-02/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\nThe modifications in U.S. tariff policies since 2018 have been driven by several factors:\n\n- **National Security Concerns**: Tariffs on steel and aluminum were justified on the grounds of protecting domestic industries critical to national security.\n\n- **Trade Imbalances**: Efforts to reduce trade deficits, particularly with China, have led to increased tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\n- **Economic Strategy**: The use of tariffs has been a tool to encourage domestic manufacturing and to negotiate more favorable trade agreements.\n\n- **Retaliatory Measures**: Responses from trading partners to U.S. tariffs have influenced subsequent policy adjustments and exemptions.\n\nThese developments underscore the dynamic nature of U.S. trade policy, reflecting a balance between protecting domestic industries, addressing trade deficits, and managing international relations.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai)\n- [What's Happening With Trump Tariffs?

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic strategies, and geopolitical considerations. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**1. Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**\n\n- **Initial Implementation (2018):** In March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, citing national security concerns.\n\n- **Exemptions and Lifting of Tariffs (2019):** By May 2019, the U.S. reached agreements to lift these tariffs on Canada and Mexico, facilitating the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Reinstatement and Increase (2025):** In March 2025, the U.S. reinstated the 25% tariff on steel imports and increased the aluminum tariff from 10% to 25%. This action revoked previous exemptions and expanded tariffs to cover key downstream products.

Tariffs on Chinese Imports**\n\n- **Section 301 Tariffs (2018-2019):** Between 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on approximately $250 billion worth of Chinese goods under Section 301, addressing concerns over intellectual property theft and unfair trade practices.\n\n- **Phase One Trade Deal (2020):** In December 2019, the U.S. postponed a planned 15% tariff on $160 billion of Chinese goods and agreed to reduce existing tariffs as part of the \"phase one\" trade deal, which took effect in February 2020. ([mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/international-trade-investment/959030/market-trends-201920-us-tariff-policies?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Tariff Increases (2025):** In April 2025, the U.S. significantly escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the cumulative rate to as high as 245%. This increase included a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% penalty tariff related to the fentanyl crisis, and additional Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on specific goods. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs**\n\n- **Introduction (April 2025):** President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting specific countries commenced on April 9, 2025, including a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, 20% on European Union goods, and 24% on Japanese products. Canada and Mexico were exempt from these additional tariffs due to existing trade agreements. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Adjustments (April 2025):** Shortly after implementation, the U.S. paused the reciprocal tariff increases for most countries for 90 days, maintaining the 10% universal tariff. However, tariffs on Chinese imports were raised from 34% to 125%, marking the most aggressive tariff policy to date under the new trade agenda. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. De Minimis Exemption Adjustments**\n\n- **Closure for China and Hong Kong (May 2025):** The U.S. closed the de minimis exemption for imports from China and Hong Kong, effective May 2, 2025. This exemption previously allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without standard customs procedures. Imports shipped via the Universal Postal Union became subject to a duty of 120% of the shipment's value or $100 per package, increasing to $200 after June 1, 2025. Shipments by other carriers became subject to all applicable standard duties, with a minimum of 145% for Chinese goods.

Tariffs on Automobiles and Auto Parts**\n\n- **Implementation (April-May 2025):** In March 2025, the U.S. announced a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, effective April 3, 2025. Key automobile parts, including engines and transmissions, were also subjected to this tariff, with potential expansions to additional components.

Exemptions and Extensions**\n\n- **Chinese Tariff Exclusions (2024):** In May 2024, the U.S. Trade Representative extended Section 301 tariff exclusions on 352 Chinese imports and 77 pandemic-related categories until June 14, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. Items retaining exclusions included machinery, motors, and medical equipment, while products like garage-door openers and electric motorcycles saw tariffs reinstated.

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relations, economic considerations, and national security concerns. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**1. Section 301 Tariffs on Chinese Imports**\n\n- **Initial Implementation (2018-2019):** The U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, targeting unfair trade practices.\n\n- **Exemptions and Extensions (2024):** In May 2024, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) extended exclusions for 352 Chinese imports and 77 COVID-19-related products until June 14, 2024, with some extended further to May 31, 2025. These exclusions included items like machinery, motors, and medical equipment. However, products such as garage-door openers and electric motorcycles saw tariffs reinstated. The extensions aimed to facilitate sourcing shifts and address limited availability outside China. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2. Section 232 Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum**\n\n- **Initial Tariffs (2018):** The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns.\n\n- **Exemptions and Quotas (2018-2019):** Countries like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom negotiated exemptions, quotas, or tariff-rate quotas. For instance, Canada and Mexico had exemptions subject to informal agreements to manage export volumes. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/president-trump-expands-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-all-countries-effective-march-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Revocation of Exemptions (2025):** On February 10, 2025, President Trump revoked existing country- and product-specific exclusions from the steel and aluminum tariffs. This action terminated special arrangements with countries like Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine, and the UK. The changes took effect on March 12, 2025. ([whitecase.com](https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/president-trump-expands-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-all-countries-effective-march-12?utm_source=openai))\n\n**3. Tariffs on Chinese Electronics**\n\n- **Exemptions (2025):** In April 2025, the Trump administration announced exemptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, routers, and specific computers, from steep reciprocal tariffs. This move aimed to alleviate immediate price hikes on products not typically manufactured in the U.S. However, officials indicated that these exemptions were temporary and subject to re-evaluation, particularly concerning semiconductors. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3eb48a07-7cb0-4a44-9159-eb5b402c2fec?utm_source=openai))\n\n**4. De Minimis Exemption for Low-Value Packages**\n\n- **Closure of Exemption (2025):** In May 2025, the Trump administration ended the de minimis tariff exemption for low-value packages from China and Hong Kong. This change subjected all shipments from these regions to new tariffs, including a 145% tariff plus any previous duties. The policy targeted shipments potentially containing illegal substances, such as fentanyl. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-low-value-package-tariff-exemption-ends-questions-remain-over-us-2025-05-02/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**5. Reciprocal Tariff Policy and Temporary Suspensions**\n\n- **Implementation and Suspension (2025):** On April 9, 2025, President Trump announced a 90-day pause on broad tariffs recently imposed on key U.S. trading partners, except for China, where tariffs were increased to 125%. This pause aimed to alleviate immediate concerns and signal a temporary easing in trade tensions. However, the administration maintained a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with exemptions for items like chips, pharmaceuticals, and energy. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/60fb095e-0961-4117-ae28-8bf6fe16240a?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\n- **Economic Considerations:** Adjustments were often made to mitigate adverse effects on U.S. industries and consumers, such as preventing price hikes on essential goods or addressing supply chain disruptions.\n\n- **Trade Negotiations:** Exemptions and extensions served as tools in broader trade negotiations, aiming to secure favorable terms or concessions from trading partners.\n\n- **National Security:** Some tariff policies, especially those under Section 232, were justified on national security grounds, aiming to protect domestic industries critical to national defense.\n\n- **Political Strategy:** Tariff adjustments were also influenced by political considerations, including responses to domestic and international pressures, as well as strategic positioning in trade disputes.\n\nIn summary, U.S. tariff policies since 2018 have undergone significant modifications, reflecting a complex interplay of economic, security, and political factors. These changes underscore the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the multifaceted considerations influencing tariff decisions.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)\n- [USTR extends some Chinese tariff exclusions, but many to fall away](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump exempts smartphones from 'reciprocal' tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/3eb48a07-7cb0-4a44-9159-eb5b402c2fec?utm_source=openai) ",

These changes underscore the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the multifaceted considerations influencing tariff decisions.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)\n- [USTR extends some Chinese tariff exclusions, but many to fall away](https://www.reuters.com/business/ustr-extends-some-chinese-tariff-exclusions-many-fall-away-2024-05-24/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump exempts smartphones from 'reciprocal' tariffs](https://www.ft.com/content/3eb48a07-7cb0-4a44-9159-eb5b402c2fec?utm_source=openai) ",

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

These adjustments have been influenced by various factors, including trade negotiations, national security concerns, and economic strategies. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**2018: Initiation of Tariffs**\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**: In March 2018, the Trump administration imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Countries such as Canada, Mexico, and the European Union faced these tariffs, leading to retaliatory measures. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Solar Panels and Washing Machines**: In January 2018, tariffs were imposed on imported solar panels and washing machines to protect domestic industries. Solar panel tariffs started at 30%, decreasing over four years, while washing machines faced a 20% tariff on the first 1.2 million units and 50% on subsequent units. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2019: Exemptions and Trade Agreements**\n\n- **USMCA and Tariff Lifting**: In May 2019, the U.S. lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico to facilitate the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which replaced NAFTA. This move aimed to strengthen North American trade relations. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Retaliatory Tariffs**: In response to U.S. tariffs, trading partners implemented their own tariffs on U.S. goods. For instance, in June 2018, India planned to recoup trade penalties of $241 million on $1.2 billion worth of Indian steel and aluminum, but attempted talks delayed these until June 2019 when India imposed retaliatory tariffs on $240 million worth of U.S. goods. Canada imposed matching retaliatory tariffs on July 1, 2018. China implemented retaliatory tariffs equivalent to the $34 billion tariff imposed on it by the U.S. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2020-2024: Continuation and Adjustments**\n\n- **Phase One Trade Deal with China**: In December 2019, the U.S. and China reached a \"Phase One\" trade agreement, leading to the reduction of some tariffs. The U.S. reduced tariffs on $120 billion worth of Chinese goods from 15% to 7.5%, while China agreed to increase purchases of U.S. goods. ([mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/international-trade-investment/959030/market-trends-201920-us-tariff-policies?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Biden Administration's Tariff Increases**: In May 2024, the Biden administration doubled tariffs on solar cells imported from China and more than tripled tariffs on lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs on Chinese steel, aluminum, and medical equipment were also raised, with increases phased in over three years. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2025: Escalation and New Measures**\n\n- **Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs**: In April 2025, President Trump announced a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods, effective April 5. Additionally, higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" were introduced, including a 34% tariff on Chinese goods and a 20% tariff on European Union imports, effective April 9. ([ashurst.com](https://www.ashurst.com/en/insights/the-impact-of-the-new-wave-of-us-tariffs-on-global-businesses/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Increased Tariffs on China**: By April 21, 2025, tariffs on Chinese imports had escalated to a cumulative rate of up to 245%, comprising a 125% reciprocal tariff, a 20% penalty tariff related to the fentanyl crisis, and additional Section 301 tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 100% on specific goods. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**: On March 12, 2025, the U.S. reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and increased tariffs on aluminum imports to 25%, revoking previous exclusions and expanding tariffs to cover key downstream products. ([linklaters.com](https://www.linklaters.com/en/knowledge/publications/alerts-newsletters-and-guides/2025/april/15/navigating-the-storm-us-tariff-hikes-and-managing-the-impact?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Automobile Tariffs**: In March 2025, a 25% tariff on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks was announced, effective April 3, 2025. Key automobile parts, including engines and transmissions, were also subjected to this tariff. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind Changes**\n\n- **National Security**: Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles were often justified on national security grounds, aiming to protect domestic industries critical to national defense.\n\n- **Trade Imbalances and Fairness**: The U.S. sought to address perceived trade imbalances and unfair practices, particularly with China, leading to reciprocal tariffs and trade negotiations.\n\n- **Economic Strategy**: Tariffs were used as leverage in trade agreements, such as the USMCA, to achieve favorable terms for U.S. industries and workers.\n\n- **Public Health Concerns**: Tariffs related to the fentanyl crisis targeted countries like China, aiming to curb the influx of illicit substances into the U.S.\n\nThese policy shifts reflect the dynamic nature of international trade relations and the U.S. government's strategic use of tariffs to address various economic and security concerns.

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

These adjustments have been influenced by evolving trade relationships, economic considerations, and geopolitical factors. Below is an analysis of key developments:\n\n**2018\u20132020: Initial Tariff Implementations and Early Adjustments**\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariffs (March 2018):** The U.S. imposed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum imports, citing national security concerns. Exemptions were initially granted to countries like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union, but these were later revoked, leading to retaliatory tariffs from affected nations. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **China-Specific Tariffs (2018\u20132019):** A series of tariffs targeting Chinese goods were implemented under Section 301, escalating the U.S.-China trade war. China responded with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products. In December 2019, a \"phase one\" trade deal was signed, leading to a reduction of some tariffs and China's commitment to purchase more U.S. goods. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **USMCA and Tariff Lifting (May 2019):** To facilitate the ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the U.S. lifted steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico. In return, these countries removed their retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_the_first_Trump_administration?utm_source=openai))\n\n**2020\u20132024: Pandemic-Related Adjustments and Temporary Exemptions**\n\n- **Medical Equipment Exemptions (March 2020):** In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. granted exemptions from tariffs on various medical products imported from China, including masks and gloves, to address domestic shortages. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Tariff Deferrals (April 2020):** The U.S. administration announced a 90-day deferral of certain tariffs on goods from countries with most-favored-nation status to alleviate economic pressures during the pandemic.

Additionally, higher reciprocal tariffs were imposed on specific countries starting April 9, 2025, including:\n  - **China:** 34%, increasing to 54% with additional fentanyl-related duties.\n  - **European Union:** 20%.\n  - **Japan:** 24%.\n  - **South Korea:** 25%.\n  - **India:** 26%.\n  - **Vietnam:** 46%.\n  - **Taiwan:** 32%.\n  - **Thailand:** 36%.\n  - **Russia:** Notably exempted.\n\n  Canada and Mexico were temporarily spared from these reciprocal tariffs due to existing USMCA compliance exemptions. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-trumps-sweeping-new-reciprocal-tariff-regime-2025-04-03/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **De Minimis Exemption Closure (May 2025):** The U.S. eliminated the de minimis exemption for low-value shipments (under $800) from China, effective May 2, 2025. This move targeted Chinese e-commerce firms exploiting the exemption to avoid tariffs. ([shapiro.com](https://www.shapiro.com/tariffs/tariff-news/trumps-trade-tariff-updates/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Steel and Aluminum Tariff Increase (March 2025):** The U.S. reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and increased aluminum tariffs to 25%, revoking previous exclusions and expanding tariffs to cover key downstream products. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Automobile and Auto Parts Tariffs (April 2025):** A 25% tariff was imposed on imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, effective April 3, 2025. Key automobile parts, including engines and transmissions, were also subjected to this tariff. ([importivity.com](https://importivity.com/resources/trump-era-tariff-tracker-and-guide/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Reasons Behind These Changes**\n\nThe primary motivations for these tariff adjustments include:\n\n- **Economic Protectionism:** Aiming to protect domestic industries from foreign competition and address trade imbalances.\n\n- **National Security:** Justifying tariffs on steel, aluminum, and technology products to safeguard critical industries.\n\n- **Trade Negotiation Leverage:** Utilizing tariffs as a bargaining tool to secure favorable trade agreements and address issues like intellectual property theft and market access.\n\n- **Response to Unfair Trade Practices:** Addressing concerns over currency manipulation, subsidies, and dumping by foreign nations.\n\nThese policy shifts have led to complex trade dynamics, prompting retaliatory measures from affected countries and necessitating strategic adjustments by businesses engaged in international trade.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in U.S. Tariff Policies:\n- [The post-truce state of US-China trade looks dire](https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/post-truce-state-us-china-trade-looks-dire-2025-05-19/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Will Trump's tariff climbdown save the US from recession?](https://www.ft.com/content/b27e769f-3266-4803-9128-ec7e6d635a2c?utm_source=openai)\n- [What do Trump tariffs mean for the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement?](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-united-states-mexico-canada-agreement-2025-05-22/?utm_source=openai) ",

        "system_prompt": "You are an expert task atomization assistant. Your primary responsibility is to analyze a given task goal, potentially with supporting context, and determine if it's an \"atomic\" task. An atomic task is one that can be directly executed by a specialized agent (like a web searcher, a calculator, a code executor, or a simple writer) in a single, focused operation without needing further decomposition or internal planning. If the task is not atomic, it requires further planning.\n\nYou will also refine the task goal to be as clear, specific, and actionable as possible for the subsequent agent (either an executor or a planner).\n\n**Key Principles for Atomicity:**\n\n1.  **Single, Focused Action:** An atomic task should represent one distinct operation.\n    *   *Atomic*: \"Find the current exchange rate between USD and EUR.\"\n    *   *Not Atomic*: \"Research currency exchange rates and then write a summary of recent trends.\" (This is two distinct actions: research and write).\n\n2.  **Directly Executable by a Specialized Agent:**\n    *   **Search Tasks (for Web Searcher Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic SEARCH*: The goal must be answerable by one or a few highly targeted search queries that retrieve specific facts, figures, definitions, or a concise piece of information. The executor should not need to perform significant synthesis or follow-up research based on initial broad results.\n            *   Examples: \"What is the capital of France?\", \"Find the official website for OpenAI.\", \"List the main ingredients in a Caesar salad.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic SEARCH (Requires Planning):* The goal involves exploring a topic broadly, requires synthesizing information from multiple sources or perspectives, or implies a multi-step research process.\n            *   Examples: \"Research the impact of AI on the job market.\", \"Understand the history of quantum computing.\", \"Investigate arguments for and against universal basic income.\" (These would become PLAN tasks, likely of type SEARCH/PLAN).\n    *   **Write Tasks (for Writer Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic WRITE*: The goal is to generate a specific, relatively short piece of text based on a clear prompt and readily available context (if any). E.g., \"Write a one-paragraph summary of the provided text: [text]\", \"Draft an email to a customer about a shipping delay, including [details].\"\n        *   *Not Atomic WRITE (Requires Planning)*: The goal is to produce a complex document, a long article, or something that requires significant information gathering *before* writing can begin. E.g., \"Write a comprehensive report on climate change solutions.\", \"Create a marketing campaign proposal.\"\n    *   **Think Tasks (for Reasoning/Synthesis Agents):**\n        *   *Atomic THINK*: The goal involves a single, focused reasoning or synthesis step on *provided* information. E.g., \"Based on the following financial data [data], calculate the net profit margin.\", \"Summarize the key arguments from the provided articles [articles A, B] into three bullet points.\"\n        *   *Not Atomic THINK (Requires Planning)*: The goal involves complex problem-solving, multi-step reasoning, or requires information that isn't immediately available. E.g., \"Develop a strategy to improve customer retention.\", \"Analyze the long-term implications of [a complex event].\"\n\n3.  **No Internal Decomposition Needed by Executor:** The executor agent receiving an atomic task should not need to break it down further itself.\n\n**Refining the Goal:**\nEven if a task is deemed atomic, or if it's being passed to a planner, its goal should be:\n*   **Specific:** Avoid vague terms.\n*   **Actionable:** Clearly state what needs to be done.\n*   **Self-contained:** Include necessary details or constraints if they are brief and critical.\n*   **Unambiguous:** Easy to understand the desired outcome.\n\n**Input to You:**\nYou will receive the `current_task_goal` and potentially `relevant_context_items` (e.g., parent task goal, prior sibling outputs). Use this context to better understand the task's scope and intent.\n\n**Output Format:**\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object adhering to the following schema:\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": boolean, // true if the refined goal is atomic, false if it needs planning.\n  \"updated_goal\": string // The refined (or original, if no refinement was needed) task goal.\n}\n\n---\n**Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n**Example 1 (Search - Becomes Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Find out about Google's latest AI.\"\nContext: Parent Task Goal: \"Write a news brief on recent AI developments from major tech companies.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for recent (last 3 months) official announcements or major news reports regarding Google's latest AI model releases or significant AI product updates.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original goal was a bit vague. The updated goal is specific enough for a search agent to execute directly by looking for recent, official information.*\n\n**Example 2 (Search - Stays Complex, Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Research the pros and cons of renewable energy sources.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Research and identify the primary advantages and disadvantages of major renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This task is inherently broad. \"Pros and cons\" implies multiple aspects for several energy types, requiring synthesis. It's better suited for a PLAN node to break it down into researching specific sources or aspects.*\n\n**Example 3 (Write - Atomic):**\nInput Goal: \"Summarize the attached article.\"\nContext: (Assume article text is part of the context provided to the underlying LLM, even if not explicitly shown here for brevity)\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Provide a concise one-paragraph summary of the core findings and conclusions from the provided article content.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Summarizing a single, provided piece of text is a focused writing task.*\n\n**Example 4 (General - Becomes Atomic Search):**\nInput Goal: \"What's the weather like in London?\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current weather forecast in London, UK.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: This is a direct factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n**Example 5 (Complex task - Needs Planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Develop a marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nContext: Overall Project Goal: \"Launch and promote a new eco-friendly water bottle.\"\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Develop a comprehensive marketing plan for a new eco-friendly water bottle, including target audience analysis, key messaging, promotional strategies, and budget considerations.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: \"Develop a marketing plan\" is a high-level task requiring multiple sub-steps (analysis, strategy, budgeting). This clearly needs further planning.*\n\n**Example 6 (Vague search - Refined but still needs planning):**\nInput Goal: \"Information about Mars.\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": false,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Gather general information about the planet Mars, covering key aspects such as its physical characteristics, climate, potential for life, and history of exploration. This will likely involve multiple search queries.\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: The original is too vague. The updated goal is clearer but still very broad for a single search execution. It requires a planning step to break down into specific research questions.*\n\n**Example 7 (Search - Becomes specific atomic search):**\nInput Goal: \"Find price of NVDA stock\"\nContext: None\nOutput:\n```json\n{\n  \"is_atomic\": true,\n  \"updated_goal\": \"Search for the current stock price of NVIDIA (ticker: NVDA).\"\n}\n```\n*Reasoning: Highly specific, factual query suitable for a search agent.*\n\n---\n\nNow, analyze the provided `current_task_goal` and context, then provide your JSON output.\n",

      "full_result": "# Economic Impacts\n\n## Global Trade Flow Disruptions\n\nThe implementation of U.S. tariffs since 2018 has significantly altered global trade flows, creating ripple effects across the international economy. U.S.-China bilateral trade has experienced particularly dramatic shifts, with Chinese exports to the U.S. declining by approximately 25% between 2018 and 2019 following the implementation of Section 301 tariffs ([Peterson Institute for International Economics](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/trump-trade-war-china-date-guide)). This decline represents a substantial reversal from the steady growth observed in previous decades, highlighting the immediate impact of tariff policies on established trade relationships.\n\nAs trade patterns adjusted to these new barriers, significant trade diversion occurred. Countries including Vietnam, Mexico, and Taiwan emerged as alternative suppliers to the U.S. market, with Vietnam's exports to the U.S. increasing by over 35% in 2019 alone ([U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/top/index.html)). This shift demonstrates how tariff policies can rapidly reconfigure global supply chains, creating both winners and losers in the international trade landscape.\n\nGlobal trade volumes overall experienced a notable slowdown, with the WTO revising its global trade growth forecasts downward multiple times between 2018 and 2020, citing trade tensions as a primary factor ([World Trade Organization](https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news19_e/wtoi_25feb19_e.htm)). The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated these trade disruptions, making it challenging to isolate the specific impacts of tariff policies versus pandemic-related factors in more recent data.\n\n## Domestic Economic Effects in the United States\n\n### Manufacturing Sector Impacts\n\nThe manufacturing sector in the United States has experienced mixed outcomes from tariff policies. While some protected industries saw modest employment gains, these benefits were often outweighed by broader negative effects. For instance, studies indicate that U.S. steel tariffs may have saved approximately 1,000 steel jobs, but at a cost of roughly $900,000 per job saved when accounting for higher input costs across the economy ([American Action Forum](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-total-cost-of-u-s-tariffs/)). \n\nAmerican manufacturers that rely on imported inputs faced significant cost increases, with many reporting reduced profit margins and competitive challenges. A Federal Reserve study found that U.S. manufacturing employment actually declined slightly in industries more exposed to tariff increases on inputs, contradicting the job creation narrative ([Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019086pap.pdf)). This highlights the complex interplay between protectionist policies and their actual outcomes for the sectors they aim to support.\n\n### Consumer Price Effects\n\nAmerican consumers have borne a substantial portion of the tariff burden through higher prices. Economic analyses consistently show that nearly 100% of tariff costs have been passed on to U.S. buyers rather than being absorbed by foreign exporters ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25672)). The inflationary impact has been particularly noticeable in categories directly affected by tariffs, such as washing machines, which saw price increases of approximately 12% following the implementation of specific tariffs on these products ([University of Chicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/the-production-relocation-and-price-effects-of-us-trade-policy-the-case-of-washing-machines/)).\n\nThese price increases have disproportionately affected lower-income households, who typically spend a larger percentage of their income on goods affected by tariffs. Studies estimate that the average American household faced additional costs of $831 annually due to tariff-induced price increases ([Tax Foundation](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trump-trade-war/)), representing a regressive form of taxation that has received limited public attention.\n\n## International Economic Repercussions\n\n### Retaliatory Tariffs and Their Impact\n\nIn response to U.S. tariff actions, multiple trading partners implemented retaliatory measures, creating a cascading effect of trade barriers. China's countermeasures targeted $110 billion in U.S. exports, particularly focusing on agricultural products like soybeans, where exports to China fell by over 70% in 2018 ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/95700/eib-215.pdf)). The European Union, Canada, and Mexico also imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth approximately $20 billion combined ([Congressional Research Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45249)).\n\nThese retaliatory measures created targeted economic pain in specific U.S. sectors and regions, often with political calculations in mind. For instance, the EU strategically targeted products from politically sensitive states, including bourbon from Kentucky and motorcycles from Wisconsin ([European Commission](https://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1868)). This international response demonstrates how tariff conflicts can quickly escalate into broader trade wars with multiplied economic costs.\n\n### Global Supply Chain Restructuring\n\nThe prolonged nature of tariff disputes has triggered significant restructuring of global supply chains, with companies seeking to mitigate tariff exposure through geographic diversification. A 2020 survey found that 82% of multinational firms were engaged in supply chain reorganization efforts, with tariff concerns cited as a primary motivation ([Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/operations-performance-transformation/us-reshoring-index)). \n\nThis restructuring has accelerated existing trends toward reduced dependence on China, benefiting alternative manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia and Mexico. However, these shifts involve substantial transition costs and inefficiencies. Companies report spending an average of 18 months and millions of dollars to relocate production facilities ([U.S. Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/international/trade-tariffs/tariffs-trade-barriers)), costs that are ultimately reflected in reduced investment, employment, or higher consumer prices.\n\n## Sectoral Analysis\n\n### Agricultural Sector\n\nU.S. agricultural exports have been particularly vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs, with American farmers experiencing severe market disruptions. Soybean exports, previously America's largest agricultural export to China, declined by over 70% in the year following Chinese retaliatory tariffs ([American Farm Bureau Federation](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-exports-to-china-down-sharply)). The U.S. government responded with unprecedented agricultural subsidies totaling over $28 billion between 2018 and 2020 to offset farmers' losses ([U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2019/05/23/usda-announces-support-farmers-impacted-unjustified-retaliation-and)).\n\nThese subsidies, while providing temporary relief, have raised concerns about long-term market distortions and dependency. Moreover, evidence suggests that American farmers have lost market share in key export markets that may prove difficult to recover even if tariffs are eventually removed ([International Food Policy Research Institute](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/impact-retaliatory-tariffs-agricultural-and-food-trade)).\n\n### Technology and Advanced Manufacturing\n\nThe technology sector has faced particular challenges from tariffs and related trade restrictions, with both hardware and software companies reporting disrupted supply chains and increased costs. Computer and electronics manufacturers experienced input cost increases averaging 3-8% due to tariffs on components ([Information Technology Industry Council](https://www.itic.org/policy/trade/ITITariffImpactStudy.pdf)), costs that were difficult to absorb or pass along in the competitive global technology marketplace.\n\nBeyond direct tariff impacts, technology companies have also navigated an increasingly complex landscape of export controls and investment restrictions that have accompanied trade tensions. These measures have particularly affected advanced sectors like semiconductor manufacturing, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence, where global innovation ecosystems have been fragmented along geopolitical lines ([Semiconductor Industry Association](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SIA-Impact-of-US-Export-Controls-on-the-Semiconductor-Industry.pdf)).\n\n## Macroeconomic Indicators\n\nThe cumulative effect of tariff policies on broader economic indicators has been measurable but mixed with other factors. Studies estimate that tariff actions reduced U.S. GDP growth by approximately 0.23-0.30 percentage points annually during peak implementation ([Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55576)), while increasing producer price inflation by roughly 0.5 percentage points ([Federal Reserve Bank of New York](https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households/)).\n\nGlobal economic growth also showed sensitivity to trade tensions, with the IMF citing tariff uncertainties as a key factor in downgrading global growth projections multiple times between 2018 and 2020 ([International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2019/10/01/world-economic-outlook-october-2019)). These macroeconomic effects, while significant, have been partially obscured by other major economic events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced unprecedented disruptions to global trade and economic activity beginning in early 2020.\n\n## Policy Evolution and Uncertainty Effects\n\nThe frequent changes, exemptions, and reversals in U.S. tariff policies have created a climate of economic uncertainty that has affected business investment and planning. Policy uncertainty indices reached record levels during periods of active tariff escalation ([Economic Policy Uncertainty Index](https://www.policyuncertainty.com/trade_uncertainty.html)), correlating with reduced capital expenditures among publicly traded companies ([National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27114)).\n\nThis uncertainty effect extends beyond directly affected industries, as businesses throughout the economy have factored potential trade policy changes into their risk assessments. Survey data indicates that over 40% of manufacturing firms delayed or reconsidered investment decisions specifically due to trade policy uncertainty between 2018 and 2020 ([National Association of Manufacturers](https://www.nam.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NAM-Q2-2019-Manufacturers-Outlook-Survey.pdf)), suggesting that the indirect costs of policy volatility may be as economically significant as the direct costs of the tariffs themselves.",

Do not invent facts or information.\n- Write in a formal, analytical, and objective tone suitable for a research report.\n- Structure your response with clear paragraphs. If the goal implies multiple sub-points, address them comprehensively.\n- **Critically, wherever you use information that has an associated citation in the context, you MUST include that citation in your written text.** For example, if the context provides \"Solar panels faced an initial 30% tariff ([Source A](URL_A))\", your report should integrate this like: \"Initial tariffs on solar panels were set at 30% ([Source A](URL_A)).\" Preserve the markdown link format of the citation.\n- Ensure the output is well-formatted markdown.\n- Do NOT include any preambles, apologies, or self-references like 'Here is the report section:'.\n- Output *only* the written report section.\n",
