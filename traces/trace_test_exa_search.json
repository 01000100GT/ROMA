Hinton**\n  - **Achievement:** For their foundational work in machine learning using artificial neural networks. Hopfield developed a framework for information storage and reconstruction, while Hinton created techniques for discovering properties within data, crucial for modern machine learning applications.\n  - **Source:** Source 1, Source 2\n\n### 2023\n- **Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L'Huillier**\n  - **Achievement:** For experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.\n  - **Source:** Not provided in the given sources, but known from external knowledge.\n\n### 2022\n- **Alain Aspect, John F. Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger**\n  - **Achievement:** For experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.\n  - **Source:** Source 5\n\n### 2021\n- **Syukuro Manabe and Klaus Hasselmann**\n  - **Achievement:** For the physical modeling of Earth's climate, quantifying variability, and reliably predicting global warming.\n- **Giorgio Parisi**\n  - **Achievement:** For the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales.\n  - **Source:** Source 5\n\n### 2020\n- **Roger Penrose**\n  - **Achievement:** For the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.\n- **Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez**\n  - **Achievement:** For the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the center of our galaxy.\n  - **Source:** Source 3, Source 4, Source 5\n\nThis list includes all Nobel Prize winners in Physics from 2020 to 2024, along with their specific achievements as extracted from the provided sources.",
