   # Better
   "Create a 10-minute podcast about AI for complete beginners, explaining
   like they're 5, with funny analogies and a warm, encouraging tone"
   ```

   - Maximum 800 words
   - Include 5 scientific facts

   - Target health-conscious readers

   1. Bullet points for quick reading
   2. One paragraph executive summary
   3. Three specific action items
   4. Risk level on scale of 1-10
   """
   ```

   outline = await agent.run("Create an outline for a mystery novel")
   
   # Follow-up request
   chapter = await agent.run(f"Based on this outline: {outline}, 
                            write Chapter 1 with a strong hook")
