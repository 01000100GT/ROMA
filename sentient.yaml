# Framework-Level Configuration ONLY
# (Your sophisticated agents are already configured in agents/configurations.py)

# LLM Infrastructure (used by your AgnoAgents)
llm:
  provider: "openrouter"  # Since you're using OpenRouter
  api_key: "your-openrouter-key"  # Or OPENROUTER_API_KEY env var

  max_retries: 3

# Cache System (for your sophisticated agent responses)

# Execution Framework
execution:
  max_concurrent_nodes: 2  # Reduced to minimize rate limiting

  rate_limit_rpm: 30  # Reduced from 60 to avoid Gemini rate limits

  # CHANGED: Default to root plan only - only review the initial high-level plan
  hitl_root_plan_only: true  # Set to true to only review root node's plan
  
  # NEW: Force root nodes to always plan (skip atomizer) - prevents atomic classification of complex queries
  force_root_node_planning: true  # Set to false to allow atomizer to decide for root nodes
  
  # These are ignored when hitl_root_plan_only is true

# NO AGENT CONFIGURATION HERE - Your agents are already perfectly configured!
