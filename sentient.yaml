# Framework-Level Configuration ONLY
# (Your sophisticated agents are already configured in agents/configurations.py)

# LLM Infrastructure (used by your AgnoAgents)
llm:
  provider: "openrouter"  # Since you're using OpenRouter
  api_key: "your-openrouter-key"  # Or OPENROUTER_API_KEY env var
  timeout: 60.0  # Longer timeout for complex reasoning
  max_retries: 3

# Cache System (for your sophisticated agent responses)  
cache:
  enabled: true
  cache_type: "file"  # Persist between sessions
  cache_dir: ".agent_cache"
  ttl_seconds: 7200  # 2 hours (longer for complex reasoning)
  max_size: 500  # Fewer but larger responses

# Execution Framework
execution:
  max_concurrent_nodes: 3  # Conservative for complex agents
  max_execution_steps: 500  # More steps for deep reasoning
  enable_hitl: true
  hitl_timeout_seconds: 600.0  # 10 minutes for human review

# Logging (for debugging your complex agents)
logging:
  level: "INFO"  # More detailed for sophisticated system
  enable_console: true
  enable_file: true
  file_path: "research_agent.log"

# Environment
environment: "research"

# NO AGENT CONFIGURATION HERE - Your agents are already perfectly configured!
